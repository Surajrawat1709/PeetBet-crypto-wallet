1. Connect to Phantom and receive userâ€™s address.
2. Obtain a one-time code (nonce) for the user.
3. Using Phantom, sign a message containing a nonce with the user's private key.
4. Authenticate user by validating the user's signature on the back end.
5. Generate a new nonce to prevent the user's signature from being compromised.
